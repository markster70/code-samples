This repository contains a number of stand-alone samples of code I havwe written in the last few months.

The examples are written in HTML / SCSS / JavaScript, and Vue.JS to give an insight into my code style, and understandung of the Front-End Languages. 

As the files are derived from client code-bases, there are no full working examples to protect my clients. 

I am able to provide URLs to live sites, as well as access to other fully operational respositories of my code if required  - please drop me a line - mark@m9digital.co.uk

Thank you for your interest,


Mark
